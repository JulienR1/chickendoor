# webApp

This part of the project is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app that communicates with the CloudService. It is used to monitor the esp32 and control it via specific commands provided by the UI.

It also uses the client side of [socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client) to communicate.

## Commands

`npm run start`: Run and watch the app locally

`npm run build`: Build the app for deployment purposes

`npm run serve`: Locally host the built app on port 3000
