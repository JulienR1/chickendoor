# Door Mock

This part of the project is a simple website that offers a few controls that mimic the behavior of the microcontroller. It offers a more simple testing environment and is meant to be operated by the developer.

It connects to the sockets provided by the [CloudService](../cloudService/README.md).

## Commands

`npm run serve`: Locally host the testing website on port 3001
